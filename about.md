I'm Sascha Strand.

I help organize, access, and transmit information. I am some digital combination of a librarian and plumber, and I love my work. 

After starting in the field in 2013 as an ETL developer, I went back to school for my masters in computer science in 2016 where I've studied concurrent and distributed systems.

This website is a personal blog about the topics in software I've found exciting and how I've charted a path through them.

Please reach out through the links on the main page if you have any questions or want to collaborate.

<!-- I believe the greatest self growth I can make for myself comes from building cool things that have some use in the world. This is what I strive to do every day personally and professionally, and I am at my happiest when I can do this as part of a team.

I work to make the cultures I'm a part of as inclusive as possible, and I believe computer systems--as infrastructure for the transmission and storage of information--can contribute real good to the world. -->
