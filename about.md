I'm Sascha Strand.

I am here to help organize, access, and transmit information. I am some combination of a librarian and plumber, and I love my work. 

After starting in the field as an ETL developer, I went back to school for my masters in computer science where I've studied concurrent and distributed systems.

I believe the greatest self growth I can make for myself comes from building cool things that have some use in the world. This is what I strive to do every day personally and professionally, and I am at my happiest when I can do this as part of a team.

I work to make the cultures I'm a part of as inclusive as possible, and I believe computer systems--as infrastructure for the transmission and storage of information--can contribute real good to the world.
