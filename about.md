I'm Sascha Strand.

I help organize, access, and transmit information. I am some combination of a librarian and digital plumber, and I love my work. 

After starting in the field in 2013 as an ETL developer, I went back to school for my masters in computer science in 2016 where I've focused in languages and parallel systems.

This website is a personal blog about the topics in software I've found exciting and how I've charted a path through them.

Please reach out through the links on the main page if you have any questions or want to collaborate.
