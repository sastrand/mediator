I wrote this for a friend who was wondering where to start learning about computer science.

To anyone with the same question, I have different recommendations based on the path you want to take into computer science.

### 1. You want to learn how to write software of all sorts

If you want to go deep, learning about what makes software of all kinds work, I'd recommend starting out the way computer science students start out at a lot of universities:
  * learn a multi-purpose language: read some books, work through a tutorial or two
  * then find some problems you want to solve and start applying your skills

For this, the language Python is pretty great. At present, universities from MIT to my alma mater Portland State University start their intro CS curriculum with Python. Python is a good language to learn in because its syntax is more intuitive than a lot of other languages and it abstracts away a lot of the details that other languages require you to keep track of. Also, it's used all over the place in industry, [consistently placing](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in the top three most widely used programming languages in the world.

To start here, you could check out these [Udemy tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/).
And for a manual, I've read and taught with Bill Lubanovic's [*Introducing Python*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028659.do), and I like it a lot. It includes some good suggested exercises to try out as well.

The real work with this track is going to be the second step--finding problems you want to solve. Once you get up and going with this language, start looking for any computing problem you can find to solve. The goal here is build programs that do stuff you want them to do. That's the creative work of software, and as soon as you latch on to a problem that you want to solve, you're doing the same work in the same mindset as any other software developer. All you will need from there is practice.

If you're not sure where to look for projects, anything you would normally do with Microsoft Excel you can do with Python ([arguably better](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8ggvx4/why_python_over_excel/)). 

If you're interested in big data work with machine learning and artificial intelligence, this is [largely done in Python](https://medium.com/@UdacityINDIA/why-use-python-for-machine-learning-e4b0b4457a77), and you could find some ML/AI tutorials and start building cool stuff there. 

And if you want to dive deeper still, taking on a smörgåsbord of problems offered up full-time, this background will prepare you to take CS classes at a university. I took this approach, going through [this post-bacc program](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/new-beginnings-reboot-your-career) in Portland and had a great experience.

### 2. You want a job building the visual, front-end of websites

If you are visually creative and not immediately interested in the way the whole wide world of computing works, I'd recommend starting here. This is the path a lot of coding boot camps will take you through, focusing on a specific set of skills for an in-demand job.

  * Learn HTML and CSS. These are languages that each do only one thing: HTML situates text on a page by organizing it into a nested, hierarchical structure, and CSS tells a web browser how to build art and style around this structured text. Beneath every fancy modern website is HTML and CSS, so for a web developer, they're a good place to start.

  * Learn Javascript. With HTML and CSS you can build anything you can think of that does not contain moving parts. But moving parts are pretty cool, so web browsers will run code that makes websites interactive. And the language for this is Javascript. Also, writing HTML and CSS by hand is repetitive and tedious, and keeping track of all the moving parts in a large website can be a problem in its own right, so there are add-ons to the Javascript language called *frameworks* like [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction) that allow you to work at a higher level to build a website. Frameworks move in and out of popularity over time, but in addition to HTML and CSS, Javascript and its frameworks make up the professional meat and potatoes of a front-end web developer.

There are a ton of tutorial and bootcamp options on this path, but [treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) is a well-known, low-cost platform for teaching yourself this material, and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/programming-for-web-development-from-scratch/?utm_source=adwords-learn&utm_medium=udemyads) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=front%20end) have competative options, too.

For someone who is visually creative, I think this path would be fun, and in my experience, there are a lot of people doing this on their own, so it's easy to find some community. In NYC, for instance, I found [a meetup](https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/) of people mostly doing just that, meeting every week, and working through problems and tutorials and job searching with some community.

Either path includes problems and abstractions that are challenging for anyone to master; taking them on is the work. Celebrate each step well-taken, follow your interests, and it's bound to be a good journey.
